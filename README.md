# Billiard Test Task
Write a "billiards" demo on canvas, without using third-party rendering libraries and physics.

Technologies: Canvas, TS, React 

Game essence: 
- There is a rectangular Canvas field, there are balls of different sizes on the rectangular field
- I can push a ball to the side with my mouse.
- The ball elastically collides with other balls and walls, part of the momentum is lost in the collision. 
- If the ball is clicked, a menu appears, made with React, with which you can change the color of the ball's fill.
